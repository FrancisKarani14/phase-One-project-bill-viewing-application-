        <h2>Welcome to Citizen Bills  Your Voice in Legislation</h2>
        <p>A bill is a formal written proposal for a new law or a change to an existing law that is presented for debate and approval by a legislative body, such as a parliament or congress. It outlines specific provisions, rules, or regulations that, if passed through the necessary legislative processes and approved by the appropriate authorities (like a president or governor), become legally binding statutes. Bills are essential tools in shaping public policy, addressing societal needs, and guiding governance. click the button to view the bill.</p><br>
